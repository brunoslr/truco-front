## Ruff Linter Instructions üìù
Ruff is a fast Python linter that can be used to ensure code quality. Follow the instructions below to use Ruff linter in this project.

### Installation üõ†Ô∏è
To install Ruff, you can use Poetry:
```bash
poetry add ruff
```

Sure, here's the revised README section with both lint and format commands:

### Running Ruff üöÄ

To run Ruff on your codebase, use the following commands:

#### Linting

To lint all Python files in the current directory and its subdirectories, use:

```bash
poetry run ruff check
```

#### Formatting

To format all Python files in the current directory and its subdirectories, use:

```bash
poetry run ruff format
```

This ensures your code is both linted and formatted consistently.

### Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è
You can configure Ruff by creating a `pyproject.toml` file in the root of your project and adding the following configuration:
```toml
[tool.ruff]
# Add your configuration options here
```
For more configuration options, refer to the [Ruff documentation](https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/).

## How to Update `codemie-tools` to the Latest Version

When new changes are merged into the `codemie-tools` repository, the build pipeline automatically pushes a new version to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/codemie-tools/).
To update the project to use the latest version of `codemie-tools`, follow these steps:

1. Update the package version in pyproject.toml:

   Open your pyproject.toml file and locate the dependency declaration for codemie-tools. Replace the local path-based dependency with the new version number. It should look similar to this:

   ```text
   codemie-tools = "x.y.z"
   ```

2. Update the Package via Poetry:

   After updating the version number in pyproject.toml, run the following command to update the codemie-tools package in your local environment:

   ```bash
   poetry update codemie-tools
   ```
   This command will download the new version from PyPI and update the project's lock file accordingly.

## How to use `codemie-tools` and develop and test it locally üêç
Need to change `codemie-tools` package in `pyproject.toml` file to the following:

```toml
codemie-tools = {path = "<Path to codemie-tools folder>", develop = true}
```

and run update of `codemie-tools` package:

```python
poetry update codemie-tools
```

`NOTE`: don't forget to revert these changes before pushing changes to the repository (`poetry.lock` as well)!

### Another option to use `codemie-tools` package from git repository directly from specific branch:

```toml
codemie-tools = {git = "https://gitbud.epam.com/epm-cdme/codemie-tools.git", branch = "main"}
```

## How to enable different connections and features üêç

### How to enable "Generate Image" tool
Need to specify 2 env variables for DALL-E model to .env file:

`DALLE_API_URL`
`DALLE_API_KEY`

### Contribution guidelines üå≥

We use trunk-based development.
This method implies that pull requests are generated directly to the `main` branch.

Branch name should match the following pattern: `EPMCDME-XX_short-description`

Commit messages should follow `EPMCDME-XX: Description of a commit`

## Handling Changes in Helm Chart

This section provides simple steps to update Helm chart and ensure the documentation is current.

Install Helm and Helm-docs:

```bash
brew install helm

brew install helm-docs
```

1. Update the Helm chart files (e.g., values.yaml, Chart.yaml, templates).
2. Run helm-docs to update documentation:

    ```bash
    helm-docs .
    ```

## Manage your own LLM and embedding models via Helm Chart

By default, AI/Run provides predefined LLM and embedding models for AWS, Azure, GCP. They can be found here: `config/llms`.

The `MODELS_ENV` is used to specify the environment for the models. For example, `MODELS_ENV=dial` will use the models from the `config/llms/llm-dial-config.yaml` file (Pattern: `llm-<MODELS_ENV>-config.yaml`). 

Example of providing LLM and embedding models for the `epm-cdme` environment:

1. Go to the `deploy-templates/values.yaml` file.
2. Add the following lines to the `values.yaml` file:

    ```yaml
    extraEnv:
      - name: MODELS_ENV
        value: "epm-cdme"

    extraVolumeMounts: |
      ...
      - name: codemie-llm-customer-config
        mountPath: /app/config/llms/llm-epm-cdme-config.yaml
        subPath: llm-epm-cdme-config.yaml
      ...
    
    extraVolumes: |
      ...
      - name: codemie-llm-customer-config
        configMap:
          name: codemie-llm-customer-config
      ...
   
    extraObjects:
      - apiVersion: v1
        kind: ConfigMap
        metadata:
          name: codemie-llm-customer-config
        data:
          llm-epm-cdme-config.yaml: |
            llm_models:
              - base_name: "gpt-4o-2024-08-06"
                deployment_name: "gpt-4o-2024-08-06"
                label: "GPT-4o 2024-08-06"
                multimodal: true
                enabled: true
                default: true
                provider: "azure_openai"
                cost:
                  input: 0.0000025
                  output: 0.000011
     
            embeddings_models:
              - base_name: "ada-002"
                deployment_name: "text-embedding-ada-002"
                label: "Text Embedding Ada"
                enabled: true
                default: true
                provider: "azure_openai"
                cost:
                  input: 0.0000001
                  output: 0
    ```

## How to Build Docker Image for SWE Testing üê≥
To build a Docker image using the swe.Dockerfile, you need to name your branch appropriately.  
Branch Name Format: swe-'<placeholder>'.  
Example: If you want to use the swe.Dockerfile, create a branch with a name like "swe-feature1".

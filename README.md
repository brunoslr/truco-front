## ESLint Instructions üìù
ESLint is a fast JavaScript linter that can be used to ensure code quality. Follow the instructions below to use ESLint in this project.

### Installation üõ†Ô∏è
To install ESLint, you can use npm:
```bash
npm install eslint --save-dev
```

### Running ESLint üöÄ

To run ESLint on your codebase, use the following commands:

#### Linting

To lint all JavaScript and TypeScript files in the current directory and its subdirectories, use:

```bash
npm run lint
```

#### Formatting

To format all JavaScript and TypeScript files in the current directory and its subdirectories, use:

```bash
npm run format
```

This ensures your code is both linted and formatted consistently.

### Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è
You can configure ESLint by creating a `.eslintrc.json` file in the root of your project and adding the following configuration:
```json
{
  "extends": "eslint:recommended",
  "parser": "@typescript-eslint/parser",
  "plugins": ["@typescript-eslint"],
  "rules": {
    // Add your configuration options here
  }
}
```
For more configuration options, refer to the [ESLint documentation](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring).

## How to Update Dependencies to the Latest Version

To update the project dependencies to the latest versions, follow these steps:

1. Update the package versions in `package.json`:

   Open your `package.json` file and locate the dependency declarations. Replace the current versions with the latest versions available.

2. Update the Packages via npm:

   After updating the version numbers in `package.json`, run the following command to update the packages in your local environment:

   ```bash
   npm update
   ```
   This command will download the new versions and update the project's lock file accordingly.

## How to Develop and Test Locally üêç
To develop and test the project locally, make necessary changes and run the following command to update dependencies:

```bash
npm update
```

`NOTE`: Don't forget to revert these changes before pushing changes to the repository (`package-lock.json` as well)!

## How to Enable Different Connections and Features üêç

### How to Enable "Generate Image" Tool
Need to specify 2 env variables for the image generation service to the `.env` file:

`IMAGE_API_URL`
`IMAGE_API_KEY`

### Contribution Guidelines üå≥

We use trunk-based development.
This method implies that pull requests are generated directly to the `main` branch.

Branch name should match the following pattern: `feature/short-description`

Commit messages should follow `Description of a commit`

## Handling Changes in Helm Chart

This section provides simple steps to update Helm chart and ensure the documentation is current.

Install Helm and Helm-docs:

```bash
brew install helm

brew install helm-docs
```

1. Update the Helm chart files (e.g., values.yaml, Chart.yaml, templates).
2. Run helm-docs to update documentation:

    ```bash
    helm-docs .
    ```

## Manage Your Own LLM and Embedding Models via Helm Chart

By default, the application provides predefined LLM and embedding models for AWS, Azure, GCP. They can be found here: `config/llms`.

The `MODELS_ENV` is used to specify the environment for the models. For example, `MODELS_ENV=dial` will use the models from the `config/llms/llm-dial-config.yaml` file (Pattern: `llm-<MODELS_ENV>-config.yaml`). 

Example of providing LLM and embedding models for the `epm-cdme` environment:

1. Go to the `deploy-templates/values.yaml` file.
2. Add the following lines to the `values.yaml` file:

    ```yaml
    extraEnv:
      - name: MODELS_ENV
        value: "epm-cdme"

    extraVolumeMounts: |
      ...
      - name: llm-customer-config
        mountPath: /app/config/llms/llm-epm-cdme-config.yaml
        subPath: llm-epm-cdme-config.yaml
      ...
    
    extraVolumes: |
      ...
      - name: llm-customer-config
        configMap:
          name: llm-customer-config
      ...
   
    extraObjects:
      - apiVersion: v1
        kind: ConfigMap
        metadata:
          name: llm-customer-config
        data:
          llm-epm-cdme-config.yaml: |
            llm_models:
              - base_name: "gpt-4o-2024-08-06"
                deployment_name: "gpt-4o-2024-08-06"
                label: "GPT-4o 2024-08-06"
                multimodal: true
                enabled: true
                default: true
                provider: "azure_openai"
                cost:
                  input: 0.0000025
                  output: 0.000011
     
            embeddings_models:
              - base_name: "ada-002"
                deployment_name: "text-embedding-ada-002"
                label: "Text Embedding Ada"
                enabled: true
                default: true
                provider: "azure_openai"
                cost:
                  input: 0.0000001
                  output: 0
    ```

## How to Build Docker Image for Development üê≥
To build a Docker image using the Dockerfile, you need to name your branch appropriately.  
Branch Name Format: dev-'<placeholder>'.  
Example: If you want to use the Dockerfile, create a branch with a name like "dev-feature1".

# Truco Mineiro Rules

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Backend API running on `http://localhost:5084`

### Installation
```bash
npm install
```

### Development
```bash
npm run dev
```
The application will be available at `http://localhost:5175` (or next available port).

### Build
```bash
npm run build
```

## API Integration

The frontend connects to the backend API with the following endpoints:

- `POST /api/game/start` - Start a new game
- `GET /api/game/{gameId}?playerSeat={seat}` - Get game state
- `POST /api/game/play-card` - Play a card
- `POST /api/game/press-button` - Perform game actions (truco, raise, fold)

## Game Flow

1. **Game Start**: Automatically creates a new game when the page loads
2. **Player Assignment**: Backend assigns player to a seat (0-3)
3. **Turn-based Play**: Players take turns playing cards
4. **Visual Feedback**: Active player highlighted with pulsing border
5. **Card Interaction**: Click cards to play them (only when it's your turn)
6. **Action Buttons**: Use Truco, Raise, and Fold buttons for game actions
7. **Score Updates**: Scores update in real-time as hands are completed

## UI/UX Features

### Visual Turn Indicators
- **Active Player**: Pulsing yellow border around the active player's avatar
- **Turn Message**: "It's your turn!" message displayed when it's the player's turn
- **Card Interactions**: Hover effects and tooltips on playable cards

### Card Interactions
- **Hover Effects**: Cards lift up and brighten when hovered (only when playable)
- **Visual Feedback**: Non-playable cards slightly grayed out
- **Click to Play**: Simply click a card to play it during your turn

### Responsive Design
- **Player Layout**: Players arranged in a square formation
- **Card Display**: Cards automatically show face-up or face-down
- **Action Log**: Collapsible action history panel
- **Team Colors**: Blue for player's team, red for opponent team

## Testing the Integration

To test the complete integration:

1. **Start Backend**: Ensure the backend API is running on port 5084
2. **Start Frontend**: Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
3. **Game Flow**: 
   - Open browser to `http://localhost:5175`
   - Navigate to the game page
   - Verify that a new game starts automatically
   - Check that players are displayed correctly
   - Verify turn indicators work (yellow pulsing border)
   - Test card clicking functionality
   - Test action buttons (Truco, Raise, Fold)

## Development Notes

- The application uses polling (1.5s intervals) to fetch game state updates
- Exponential backoff is implemented for error handling
- All API calls include proper error handling and logging
- Turn-based logic ensures only the active player can interact with cards
- Visual feedback provides clear indication of game state and available actions

## Next Steps

1. **Backend Testing**: Test with full 4-player game flow
2. **Game Completion**: Handle end-game scenarios and score limits
3. **Reconnection**: Add support for reconnecting to existing games
4. **Mobile Support**: Optimize for mobile device interactions
5. **Sound Effects**: Add audio feedback for actions and turns
